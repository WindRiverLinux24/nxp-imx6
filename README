5.4 USB feature
---------------

5.4.1 USB OTG Usage and verification
------------------------------------

1. Verify the OTG device mode

Plug in cable B and connect to the host machine.

Board configuration:

        # ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.10

Host machine configuration:

        # sudo ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.100
        # ping 192.168.1.10 -c 2
        PING 192.168.1.10 (192.168.1.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
        64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=2.06 ms
        64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.286 ms
        ...

2. Switch to OTG host mode

Replace cable B with cable A.

5.5 Audio
---------
Play audio messages:

For imx6ul, enable Output Mixer PCM like the following:
amixer sset 'Right Output Mixer PCM' on
amixer sset 'Left Output Mixer PCM' on

        # aplay -Dhw:0,0 stereo1644s.wav

5.6 Backlight
--------------

        # echo 0 > /sys/class/backlight/backlight/brightness

5.7 PCIe
--------

Since the on-board PCIe connector only exports the PETP0/N0, PERP0/N0 and 3.3V
pins, any mini-PCIe devices that use other PCIe pins are not supported.
The following PCIe peripherals:

        Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205
        Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1030

can be validated using the following steps:

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

        KERNEL_FEATURES_append = " features/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.scc"

This will include the iwlwifi and mac80211 kernel modules in
the root filesystem.

echo IMAGE_INSTALL += "linux-firmware-iwlwifi" >> conf/local.conf
This will add relevant WiFi card firmware (Intel 6205 WiFi firmware: iwlwifi-6000g2a-5.ucode) 

Built and install them:

        # bitbake wrlinux-image-glibc-xxx

Execute the following commands to validate the WiFi cards:

        # ifconfig wlan0 up
        # iwconfig wlan0 essid <AP essid>
        # dhclient wlan0
        # ping <AP address> -i wlan0 -c 1

NOTE: the PCIe driver does not support hotplug and suspend/resume.

5.8 Graphics/GPU
----------------

If you want to build a project with i.mx6 GPU graphic support, please
follow the steps as below:

Create a project directory, and then setup project with the following arguments:

        --machines nxp-imx6 --distros wrlinux-graphics --dl-layers

Setup environment and create a build directory:

        # . environment-setup-<host>-wrlinuxsdk-linux
        # . oe-init-build-env <build>
        # bitbake wrlinux-image-std-sato

Generate imx6 graphic layer:
Because of the licensing issue, nxp-imx6 layer doesn't integrate imx6's GPU or VPU
hardware acceleration related packages into WRlinux product. So, if customer wants
to run hardware graphic feature, please generate graphic with script scripts/generate-graphic-layer.sh.
Detailed steps as below:
<1>. Download SDK package(L5.10.9_1.0.0_MX6QDLSOLOX) with below command
        # mkdir imx-yocto-bsp
        # cd imx-yocto-bsp
        # repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest -b imx-linux-gatesgarth -m imx-5.10.9-1.0.0.xml
        # repo sync

<2>. Run scripts/generate-graphic-layer.sh script and set correct command-line options
        # ./generate-graphic-layer.sh -h
         Usage: source generate-graphic-layer.sh
            Optional parameters: [-s source-dir] [-d destination-dir] [-h]

            * [-s source-dir]: Source directory where the graphic layer come from
            * [-d destination-dir]: Destination directory where the graphic will be merged into
            * [-h]: help

        # ./generate-graphic-layer.sh -s <nxp-sdk download directory>/imx-yocto-bsp/sources -d <wrlinux project directory>/layers/nxp-imx6/

<3> Read WARNING information carefully, and then input 'y' if you want to generate imx6 graphic layer

Use the command as below to add i.mx6 GPU graphic layer:

        bitbake-layers add-layer path_to_WRLinux_product/layers/nxp-imx6/imx6-graphic

Use the command as below to build rootfs:

        bitbake wrlinux-image-std-sato

NOTE:

1. You must change the configuration to allow downloading of packages from the
internet. Change BB_NO_NETWORK ?= "1" to BB_NO_NETWORK ?= "0" in the file
${buildprj}/conf/local.conf.

2. Since some packages which are used to support the graphic feature in
nxp-imx6 are provided via binaries, when a nxp-imx6 project with
graphic support is built, there will be error info as below:
-----------ERROR--------------
ERROR: imx-gpu-viv_6.4.0.p1.0-aarch32 do_unpack: To use 'imx-gpu-viv' you need to accept the Freescale EULA at 'path_to_WRLinux_product/layers/meta-freescale/EULA'. Please read it and in case you accept it, write: ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1" in your local.conf.
------------------------------
Please read the Freescale EULA file carefully, in case you accept it, write:
ACCEPT_FSL_EULA = "1" to your local.conf file to continue the building.

6. kexec/kdump
==============

For discussion purposes, some useful terminology will be described here.

* boot kernel - the first kernel that you start and supports kexec, from U-Boot
              for instance
* capture kernel - the kernel that you reboot into after a boot kernel crash

To build the boot kernel, enable kexec and kdump in your local.conf file:

        WRTEMPLATE = "feature/kexec feature/kdump"

6.1 kdump
---------

For the boot kernel:
To reserve a memory region for the capture kernel, you need to pass the bootargs
argument "crashkernel" to the boot kernel as follow:
 - Without graphic hardware accelerator
for I.MX6Q:
    crashkernel=128M
for I.MX6SX:
    crashkernel=180M
for I.MX6UL:
    crashkernel=128M

For the dump-capture kernel:
Before booting the dump-capture kernel, add "maxcpus=1 cma=16M" to the boot parameter.
NOTE: Use zImage as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx6/ directory.

For more detailed info about kdump, refer to Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
in the kernel source tree.

6. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After building the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx6/wrlinux-image-std-nxp-imx6.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card:

Since this BSP doesn't have a firmware to read the uboot from a partition table,
WIC image only contains kernel, dtb and rootfs. We still need to write U-boot
image to SD card directly by "dd" command.

7.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn uboot and WIC images to SD card, user need to execute command:
For i.mx6ul:
# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-nxp-imx6.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

For i.mx6sx:
# dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-std-sato-nxp-imx6-imx6sx.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

Prepare the bootloader image, user can get it from www.nxp.com
# dd if=u-boot-imx6ul14x14evk_sd.imx of=/dev/your_sd_dev bs=1k seek=<x> conv=fsync

Note: seek = "1"

7.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

For i.mx6ul
=> setenv bootfile zImage; setenv fdtfile imx6ul-14x14-evk.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x80800000; setenv fdtaddr 0x83000000;
=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=ttymxc0,115200n8'
=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 1:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 1:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; bootz $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';
=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

For i.mx6sx
=> setenv bootfile zImage; setenv fdtfile imx6ul-14x14-evk.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x92000000; setenv fdtaddr 0x98000000;
=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=ttymxc0,115200n8'
=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 1:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 1:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; bootz $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';
=> saveenv; run bootcmd;
